# AI News Aggregator - Complete Technical Analysis

## Project Overview

The AI News Aggregator is an Electron-based desktop application that combines RSS feed aggregation with AI-powered article summarization. The application fetches articles from multiple RSS feeds, organizes them in folders, and uses local AI models (via Ollama) to generate concise summaries.

## Architecture Analysis

### Core Technologies
- **Framework**: Electron (v36.4.0) - Desktop application framework
- **Database**: SQLite3 (v5.1.7) - Local data persistence

#### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE folders (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    parentId INTEGER,
    orderIndex INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    createdAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (parentId) REFERENCES folders (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE feeds (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    url TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    displayName TEXT,
    folderId INTEGER,
    orderIndex INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    createdAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (folderId) REFERENCES folders (id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

CREATE TABLE articles (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    feedId INTEGER NOT NULL,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    link TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    pubDate TEXT,
    content TEXT,
    summary TEXT,
    isRead BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'new',
    createdAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (feedId) REFERENCES feeds (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

## Core Features Analysis

### 1. Agent System Architecture
The application implements a multi-agent background processing system:

- **Agent Cycle**: Runs every 5 minutes (main.js:44)
- **Fetcher Agent**: Polls RSS feeds, stores new articles with status 'new'
- **Summarizer Agent**: Processes articles in batches of 5, generates AI summaries

### 2. Feed Management
- RSS feed validation and parsing
- Hierarchical folder organization with drag-and-drop
- Custom display names for feeds
- Feed ordering within folders

### 3. AI Summarization Pipeline
- Content sanitization and truncation (15,000 characters max)
- Structured prompting for consistent output format
- Configurable AI model selection (default: phi3:mini)
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

### 4. User Interface
- Three-panel layout: Feeds | Articles | Content
- Real-time status updates via IPC messaging
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Drag-and-drop feed organization

## Performance Analysis

### Current Performance Characteristics

#### Strengths
1. **Local Processing**: All data stored locally, no external dependencies except Ollama
2. **Batch Processing**: Articles processed in batches of 5 to prevent overwhelming
3. **Database Efficiency**: SQLite with proper indexing on unique constraints
4. **Memory Management**: Limited content truncation prevents memory bloat

#### Performance Bottlenecks
1. **RSS Parsing**: Sequential processing of feeds (main.js:55-82)
2. **AI Processing**: Blocking synchronous summarization (main.js:101-111)
3. **Database Operations**: No connection pooling, synchronous queries
4. **Frontend Rendering**: Large article lists without virtualization
5. **Content Loading**: Full content loaded for all articles regardless of visibility

### Scalability Concerns
- No pagination for articles
- No background indexing for search
- Limited to single Ollama instance
- No feed update optimization (always fetches full feed)

## Security Assessment

### Current Security Measures
1. **Content Sanitization**: HTML stripping via sanitize-html
2. **Context Isolation**: Proper Electron security with preload script
3. **Input Validation**: URL validation for RSS feeds
4. **Local Storage**: No external data transmission

### Security Considerations
1. **AI Model Safety**: Limited control over Ollama model responses
2. **Feed Validation**: Basic URL validation, potential for malicious feeds
3. **Content Injection**: Markdown rendering could be vulnerable
4. **File System Access**: Database file accessible to other processes
